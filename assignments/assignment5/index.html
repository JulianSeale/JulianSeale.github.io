        <h4>Research is a learning tool of the highest order at the University of South Carolina.
             Discovery allows us to illuminate history, contextualize the present, and help plan for what’s to come.</h4>
             <p>
                Scientific research, scholarship and creative activity abound throughout USC. That focused presence within nearly all colleges, departments and campuses of the state’s
                 flagship university is one reason Carnegie Foundation has designated South Carolina as an institution of very high research activity.
